# EPOCH v8 - Manufacturing ERP System

## Overview

This is a full-stack manufacturing ERP system built with React, TypeScript, Express, and PostgreSQL. The application focuses on order management with features for generating order IDs, importing CSV data, and managing manufacturing orders. It uses modern web technologies including ShadCN UI components, Drizzle ORM, and TanStack Query for efficient data management.

## Recent Changes

- **August 3, 2025 (Evening)**: SHIPPING DEPARTMENT QUEUE MANAGER ENHANCEMENTS - Added three action buttons to each order in the shipping queue: QC Checklist PDF generation, Sales Order PDF generation, and UPS Shipping Label creation. Created ShippingActions component with modal forms for shipping address and package details. Implemented comprehensive PDF generation API endpoints using pdf-lib for professional document creation. Added bulk shipping functionality with checkboxes for multi-order selection, automatic tracking number generation, and integrated customer notification system via email/SMS.
- **July 16, 2025 (Evening)**: ARCHITECTURE CLARIFICATION & DOCUMENTATION - Addressed framework confusion feedback by creating comprehensive README.md documenting tech stack choices (Vite+React, not Next.js). Reorganized database schema to `/server/schema.ts` while maintaining `/shared/schema.ts` re-export for client access. Added clear project structure documentation and architecture decisions.
- **July 16, 2025 (Evening)**: PROJECT STRUCTURE REORGANIZATION - Successfully cleaned up "monolithic root" issue by organizing files into logical folders: moved all debug/test scripts to `/scripts`, data files to `/data`, documentation to `/docs`, while preserving working `/client`, `/server`, `/shared` structure. Application continues running without interruption.
- **July 16, 2025 (Evening)**: TIME CLOCK ADMINISTRATION ENHANCEMENT - Added "Current Date" field to Time Clock Administration modal for both Add Entry and Edit Entry dialogs. Field auto-defaults to today's date and is user-editable.
- **July 15, 2025 (Afternoon)**: REACT RUNTIME ERROR - PERSISTENT ISSUE - Unable to resolve "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')" error despite multiple approaches including removing TooltipProvider components, creating minimal React apps, explicit React imports, and React runtime configuration. Issue appears to be fundamental React initialization problem in Replit environment. Implemented HTML fallback solution to maintain application functionality while React issue persists. Backend API fully functional on port 5000.
- **July 15, 2025 (Afternoon)**: DATABASE CONNECTION ISSUE RESOLVED - Fixed critical database connectivity timeout issue by switching from WebSocket-based Neon connection to HTTP-based connection. Changed from 'drizzle-orm/neon-serverless' with Pool to 'drizzle-orm/neon-http' with neon() function. Application now starts successfully and all API endpoints are functional.
- **July 15, 2025 (Morning)**: RAILS FEATURE ISSUE RESOLVED - Fixed rail feature not displaying in Features Manager and Order Entry by correcting feature type from 'text' to 'dropdown' in database. Rail Accessory feature now properly shows with dropdown options (No Rail, 4" ARCA Rail, 6" ARCA Rail, 8" ARCA Rail, Pic, Pic w/Int Stud) with correct pricing.
- **July 15, 2025 (Morning)**: STYLING ISSUES RESOLVED - Fixed critical styling problems that were causing "blocky" appearance by removing HTML fallback content overriding React, adding proper CSS imports to main.tsx, and cleaning up index.html. Application now displays with professional modern UI components, cards, buttons, and proper Tailwind styling.
- **July 15, 2025 (Morning)**: APPLICATION FULLY RESTORED - Cleaned up main.tsx to remove test components and restore normal ERP functionality. Application now properly renders the full EPOCH v8 ERP system with all modules accessible through navigation. React refresh runtime fixes maintained while eliminating temporary test interfaces.
- **July 15, 2025 (Morning)**: ISSUE RESOLVED - Successfully eliminated RefreshRuntime.register errors by completely disabling React refresh runtime. Implemented permanent stubs for $RefreshReg$ and $RefreshSig$ functions, disabled HMR to prevent conflicts, and restored React application functionality. Application now renders properly with working test component and restoration button.
- **July 15, 2025 (Early Morning)**: CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED - Vite React plugin configuration error causing React app to not render. Error: "@vitejs/plugin-react can't detect preamble" prevents React components from mounting. Root cause: Vite plugin setup issue, not Babel parsing error. React dependencies installed correctly but React runtime failing to initialize.
- **July 15, 2025 (Early Morning)**: Successfully resolved persistent React runtime error "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useRef')" - identified root cause as mixed React import patterns in UI components, systematically fixed all React hook imports (use-toast.ts, use-mobile.tsx, QCManager.tsx, sidebar.tsx, carousel.tsx, DiscountAdmin.tsx, EnhancedReportBuilder.tsx), isolated error to OrderManagement->CSVImport component chain, restored full application functionality
